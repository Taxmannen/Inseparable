## **DISCLAIMER**
**The game is not finished, and there is probably bugs that might ruin your experience.** <br>
With that in mind, you maybe continue reading.

## Graphics
Majority of the things in the game lacks the final texture or particles, but has a working mechanic. For example the lever or pressure plate does work like it should, but does not have the correct texture.

The current graphics are placeholders while working with the digital designers on the final art. However the current art does give a good "feel" on the game.

## Controls
It's worth noting that the game is designed with a controller in mind, so keyboard controls might not be as enjoyable.
The controls are available the game's settings.

Since the game is not final, and the controls being a part of the game, we can't say there isn't a bug or unexpected interaction in the game.

Little MVP notice: `Throw mechanic does not work for second player in build, but works in editor.`

## Goal
The goal is to use the mechanics available to get you and your friend to the end of the course.
